<h1 align="left" style="margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%;">Corona Virus :- Difficulty and Opportunity ...    </h1>

<p  align="left" style="margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%;"><strong>
   

    The Virus which is effecting us is still here in our surroundings . It has been effecting the lives of all 
    from children to oldest irrespective of their class and professions . All of us are fighting with it and will 
     continue to fight until we win ( which is absolutely sure ) . <br>
    As it is said that we should always focus on GREY ZONE  , that is we shouldn't see any situations as black or white .
     We must have grey zone in our in perspective . In simpler words we must remain calm and positive in all situations .
      There is definetely a negative effect on us but i am sure that we all have
       courage to bring out positivity from the bottom of the hell and we will surely smackdown this Corona Virus .</strong> </p>
    <h4 align="left" style="margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%;">Let us throw some light on grey zone ( the zone which comprises of both positives and negatives of this  situation ) --->
    This virus is effecting all of us in different manners . Such as :-</h4><br><ul align="left" style="margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%;" >
        <li>  It has taken all of our freedom and created a lot of uncertainity in our futures . </li>
        <li>  It has disturbed our daily routine and many of us are struggling to adjust in this very new
             situations .</li>
        <li>  Many of us are unable to handle and utilise the extra time which we had never got before in 
            our lives . </li>
        <li>   We all are struggling from these online classes as we all know offline classes are more 
            interesting and interacting ( and also our education system is not fully developed for online 
            and also we all are missing our friends and college campus ) .</li>
        <li>  We all are totally unsure about uncertainity in  our upcoming exams ( in my personel view it
             is fault of our education system and education minister ) .</li>
        <li> Our productivity has decreased and restricted to certain limits in these situations . We all 
            are unable to utilise time more productively now a days . </li>
        <li> Some of us are also suffering from the harsh words of our family members as they are not fully 
            able to understand our feelings and thoughts ( which are flooded with negativity and uncertainity )
             but they always want to see their children studying ( which is definetely not possible in these situations ) .
     And there are many more negatives and sufferings which we all are facing now a days due to this corona 
     virus .</li> <br>
   <h4 >But as i said earlier that we should always focus on our " GREY ZONES " , so there are many positive
     also in these situations . Let us throw some light on POSITIVES of this situation . Some of them are :-</h4>
    <li>- We all have a lot of free times which we never had before and it is upto us that how we will utilise
         this time ( develop a courage to get maximum out of it ) .</li>
    <li></li> - We can develop a new hobby or can pursue the hobby which we are unable to do due to less time . </li>
    <li>- We can work different from our syllabus and can try something new in which we are interested . </li>
    <li>- This situation has teaches us to think about our physical and mental health and also immune system 
        which we all had ignored a lot .  </li>
    <li> - We can create something new and can show to the  our colleague like we can make websites , we can
         write blogs , we can read a lot of books , we can develop an apps , we can build body and many more
          things we can do . But we have to develop a courage to complete that task which we started , i am 
          not talking about failing , we must fail but we never stop . </li>
    <li>- Now we all have time to stop racing for success and to stop for few moments and to think about
         ourselves , our inner self . We must solve our inner conflicts and war between our thoughts which
          are always going on inside our brain and heart . </li>
        <li> - We all should utilise these times to develop ourselves , to calm ourselves from this rat race
             , to solve our inner conflicts and beliefs and to bring our mind , soul , heart and whole body 
             in state of calm and peace .</li>
</ul>
 <p align="left" style="margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%;"><strong> There are many more positives which we all can find within us just by focusing and listening to us . 
  As it is said " IF YOU FOCUS ON SHIT , SHIT WILL GROW AND IF YOU FOCUS ON YOU , YOU WILL GROW " .
     So at last , i will say that have a courage and will power to focus on the right things in right way
      and to take out positives from any situations and always remember to have your vision in GREY ZONE 
       as there is no black and white there is always a grey zone in each and every situations , so bring 
       out positives from every situations and handle the negatives with a smile . 
    I know " it is easier to be said than done " but we can always try our best and have courage to bring
     out positives and develop ourselves in these drastic and dramatic situations also . 
    As Steve Harvey said :- " If you are going through HELL , keep going . Why would you stop in a HELL ? "
    
    So , BE POSITIVE and HAVE COURAGE to develop your own self in each and every area of your  LIFE .
