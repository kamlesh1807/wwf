      On Incresing  Cyber Attack In INDIA
                  Hello Everyone, Today with the help of this writing platform i want to share my thoughts related to how people get hacked very easily in our country.
        I do not know why people of our country takes a mobile phone if they do not know to operate it in manner and therefore get easily hacked. 
       I think their should be some strong security policies in our country and their should be some prerequisite type of thing for the people to learn some sort of 
      security measures before the use of any electronic device. The people of our country specially the villagers ,who even do not know english language properly and
       not a little bit about the technology on which smartphones and internet works ,starts to use a smartphones.the hackers takes advantage of this and easily gets
       much sensitive information of them and also use that information in the financial frauds.  An the biggest problem is the people from villages or uneducated type
       of people easily get into this and easily hacked ,loss personal information , some sensitive data and also even caught into the financial frauds.The thing is
       that the hackers don't do some sort of big things, they only do very small things like generate a link and give some greedy type of advertisements like paytm 
      cashback or prices like car, scooters on the occations of 10years etc by just register to them, they get much useful information of many people. By that they 
      create their own big data collections, And who knows  how they use their informations but the big hackers never do this small tasks so, i think they are some 
      noobs, they only want or get some money with that. But the thing is that if people are aware about some security measures and all so, i think many of the problems 
      related to violation of privacy and all like that will solve.So, According to me their is a need of some bahavioral change in the society, nowadays, people spread
       many applications like mitron, Remove china apps, etc these applications are just frauds to make fool the indian peoples in name of country, and the people of our 
      country are very emotional so they become fool very easily. So As the infosec guy, At last I want to say that before installing any untrusted application, first we 
      should verify the creator of application and check its privacy policies then think of installing it and We should take care of these small things and make our
       personal information secure because now important data values more than the money.  Thanks alot for giving your valuable time and Have a good day ahead.
                                                                                                                                              -By    utkarsh
