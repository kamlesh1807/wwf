        <blockquote>     <p  align="left" style="font-family: Roboto ; color:white;"  > <i> <br>On Incresing  Cyber Attack In INDIA<br><br>Hello Everyone, Today with the help of this writing platform i want to share my thoughts related to how people get hacked very easily in our country.
I do not know why people of our country takes a mobile phone if they do not know to operate it in security manner and therefore get easily hacked.
I think their should be some strong security policies in our country and their should be some prerequisite type of thing for the people to learn some sort of security measures before the use of any electronic device.
The people of our country specially the villagers ,who even do not know english language properly and not a little bit about the technology on which smartphones and internet works ,starts to use a smartphones.the hackers
takes advantage of this and easily gets much sensitive information of them and also use that information in the financial frauds.
And the biggest problem is the people from villages or uneducated type of people easily get into this and easily hacked ,loss personal information , some sensitive data and also even caught into the financial frauds.The
thing is that the hackers don't do some sort of big things, they only do very small things like generate a link and give some greedy type of advertisements like paytm cashback or prices like car, scooters on the occations
of 10years etc by just register to them, they get much useful information of many people. By that they create their own big data collections, And who knows how they use their informations but the big hackers never do this 
small tasks so, i think they are some noobs, they only want or get some money with that. But the thing is that if people are aware about some security measures and all so, i think many of the problems related to violation 
of privacy and all like that will solve.So, According to me their is a need of some bahavioral change in the society, nowadays, people spread many applications like mitron, Remove china apps, etc these applications are just 
frauds to make fool the indian peoples in name of country, and the people of our country are very emotional so they become fool very easily. So As the infosec guy, At last I want to say that before installing any untrusted 
application, first we should verify the creator of application and check its privacy policies then think of installing it and We should take care of these small things and make our personal information secure because now
important data values more than the money.Thanks alot for giving your valuable time and Have a good day ahead.<br></i><b>--By Utkarsh</b>
